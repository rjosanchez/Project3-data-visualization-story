# BandsInTown Artist Events: Leaflet, API, MongoDB, Bootstrap

Mapping Popular Artist's Past, Upcoming, and All Events using BandsInTown API
Jo Sanchez | Danny Flanagan | Ryann Hawkins 

This project is an ETL project where we collected music artists' data from the BandsInTown API, and looked to draw a comparison between event locations as well as upcoming and past events.
Please view the following images from our presentation slide in order to gain a better understanding of our project. Then, feel free to launch our site using a live server through VScode or using our github.io. Enjoy!
